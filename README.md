Cheatle app written for JAWAD meetup

This is an iOS app that helps you out with Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

The app lets you plug in the state of your wordle board then will filter a list of all 5 letter words in the English language to show 
a list of all possible options.
